# Apology interactive webpage — Babi → Chinie

This is a single-page interactive apology experience built as an MVP. It contains 7 interactive screens: wake-up, slider reveal, heart pop game, gift box, forgive buttons, secret shake message, and a final hug.

How to run
- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve from a simple static server).

Notes
- On desktop you can press `S` to simulate the phone shake for the secret screen.
- The NO button moves away when touched/cursor enters.
- Animations are CSS/JS-only; no external dependencies.

Customization
- Edit messages in `index.html` to personalize further.

Files
- `index.html` — UI and structure
- `styles.css` — styles & animations
- `script.js` — interactive logic

If you want, I can:
- Add sounds for pops and confetti
- Optimize for accessibility and keyboard-only navigation
- Bundle into a tiny deployable (GitHub Pages) and provide hosting steps
